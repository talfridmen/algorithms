# algorithms
Each directory in this repo contains only a readme file describing the algorithm that you need to implement

## How to work
Create your own branch: <your name>/main
This will, from now on, be your main branch.
For each algorithm, create a seperate branch <your name>/<algorithm name> and implement it on that branch.
once the algorithm is fully implemented, and you are happy with the results, open a PR pushing your algorithm branch to your main branch.

#### Example:
I will create a branch called tf/main.
when I develop the algorithm called fibonacci, I will create a branch called tf/fibonacci.
When ready, I will create a PR from tf/fibonacci to tf/main.

## Branches PATBAS/*
For each algorithm there is a branch names PATBAS/<algorithm name>.
This branch contains a suggested implementation for the algorithms.
For some of these algorithms there might be more than one solution.

The purpose of this branch is to help you in case you get stuck. Please do not look at the solution before trying yourself first as it will simply ruin the fun :)

*** There might be other solutions not implemented here. This is merely a suggestion.
