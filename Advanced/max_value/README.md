# Max Value

## What will we do?
We will search for the largest value in a list. Notice - the list is NOT sorted.

## How will it work?
We will iterate over the list of elements, keeping a single variable that will hold the value of the largest element.

## How do we implement it?
- Create a function that receives a list.
- Initialize a max variable
  - To what value?
- Iterate over the list
- In each iteration, check if the current value is greater than the current max variable. If so, replace the value of the max variable with the current element
- When the loop finishes, return the max value.

## More
- Think of other things we could be looking for in a list. How will you modify the function to look for that?
- What would you do if we wanted to find multiple values in the list? How would that affect the function?
