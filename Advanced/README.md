# Advanced Exercises

In this part of the exercise, we will write more complex functions, that make use of some of the features of the language - lists, libraries, and so on.
The algorithms here will teach you how to use more complex data structures, while still basic ones that are provided out-of-the-box in the python language.

In each exercise, there is an explanation of what is expected of you to implement, and a walkthrough of the steps required to implement it.

If you feel confident in your understanding, you may also skip the walkthrough, and try implementing it yourself first.

_Notice: the walkthrough does not contain any line of code. This is up to you to implement._
