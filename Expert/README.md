# Expert Exercises

In this part of the exercise, You will need to understand the algorithm and implement it yourself without a walkthrough.

These exercises focus on more advanced techniques, such as recursion, usage of helper data structures and so on.

Inside each exercise, there are already the Objects you will require to implement the algorithm. These should not be modified. They provide all the functionality required to solve this algorithm. I do recommend you first go through the Objects' implementations to understand their functionality and meaning.

_Notice: Even though most of these algorithms are already implemented in a way that could be imported and called immediately, the idea is to implement them yourselves._
