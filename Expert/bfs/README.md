# BFS
##### From wikipedia
Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for searching a tree data structure for a node that satisfies a given property. It starts at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. Extra memory, usually a queue, is needed to keep track of the child nodes that were encountered but not yet explored.

## What will we do?
We will implement a BFS algorithm that will scan through a tree to check if an element exists in the tree.

## How will it work?
You may decide which type of algorithm you want to implement for this, but it has to be a BFS search. 
Think which other data structures you will need to hold in order to achieve this algorithm.
