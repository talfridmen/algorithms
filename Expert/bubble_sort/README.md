# Bubble Sort
##### From wikipedia
Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the input list element by element, comparing the current element with the one after it, swapping their values if needed. These passes through the list are repeated until no swaps have to be performed during a pass, meaning that the list has become fully sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way the larger elements "bubble" up to the top of the list.

## What will we do?
We will implement a Bubble Sort algorithm that will scan through a list repeatedly, and swap adjacent cells if they are out of order. The algorithm will return a sorted list.

## How will it work?
You may decide which type of algorithm you want to implement for this, but it has to be a Bubble sort. 
Think of all the skills you have learned so far, and choose how to implement this.
