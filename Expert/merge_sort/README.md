# Merge Sort
##### From wikipedia
In computer science, merge sort (also commonly spelled as mergesort) is an efficient, general-purpose, and comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the relative order of equal elements is the same in the input and output. Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945.

## What will we do?
We will implement a Merge Sort algorithm that will break the list down further and further, and build it up back together is a sorted manner.

## How will it work?
You may decide which type of algorithm you want to implement for this, but it has to be a Merge sort. 
For all types of Divide-and-Conquer algorithms, a recursive approach is usually very useful.
