# DFS
##### From wikipedia
Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Extra memory, usually a stack, is needed to keep track of the nodes discovered so far along a specified branch which helps in backtracking of the graph.

## What will we do?
We will implement a DFS algorithm that will scan through a tree to check if an element exists in the tree.
Although it is possible to implement otherwise, I recommend you to try a recursive approach.

## How will it work?
You may decide which type of algorithm you want to implement for this, but it has to be a DFS search.
