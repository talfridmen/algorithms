# Basic Exercises

In this part of the exercise, we will write simple functions.
The algorithms here will teach you basic type handling, if-statements, and loops.
Each function should consist of just a few lines. 

In each exercise, there is an explanation of what is expected of you to implement, and a walkthrough of the steps required to implement it.

If you feel confident in your understanding, you may also skip the walkthrough, and try implementing it yourself first.

_Notice: the walkthrough does not contain any line of code. This is up to you to implement._
